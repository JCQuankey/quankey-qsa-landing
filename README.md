# Quankey QSA -- Landing Page

Landing page for **Quankey QSA** (Quantum-Safe Assurance), an on-premises TLS crypto hygiene and PQC readiness scanner.

## What is QSA?

QSA is a command-line tool that scans your TLS endpoints and produces two scores:

- **Crypto Hygiene** (0-100): Current cipher suite, protocol version, and certificate health
- **PQC Readiness** (0-100): Degree to which endpoints support Post-Quantum Cryptography key exchange

Output is an auditable evidence pack with SHA-256 hash-chain integrity, designed for compliance teams.
